When I find myself in times of trouble Mother-
Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, le-
t it be. And in my hour of darkness She is st-
anding right in front of me Speaking words of-
wisdom, let it be. Let it be, let it be. Whis-
per words of wisdom, let it be. And when the 
broken hearted people Living in the world agr-
ee, There will be an answer, let it be. For t-
hough they may be parted there is Still a cha-
nce that they will see There will be an answe-
r, let it be Let it be, let it be. Yeah There-
will be an answer, let it be. And when the ni-
ght is cloudy, There is still a light that sh-
ines on me, Shine on until tomorrow, let it b-
e. I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mar-
y comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let i-
t be. Let it be, let it be. There will be an 
answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be, Whis-
per words of wisdom, let it be.

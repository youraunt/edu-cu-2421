eaking words 
of wisdom, le-
t it be. And 
in my hour of-
darkness She 
is standing r-
ight in front-
of me Speakin-
g words of wi-
sdom, let it 
be. Let it be-
, let it be. 
Whisper words-
of wisdom, le-
t it be. And 
when the brok-
en hearted pe-
ople Living i-
n the world a-
gree, There w-
ill be an ans-
wer, let it b-
e. For though-
they may be p-
arted there i-
s Still a cha-
nce that they-
will see Ther-

answer, let i-
t be Let it b-
e, let it be.

e night is cl-
oudy, There i-
